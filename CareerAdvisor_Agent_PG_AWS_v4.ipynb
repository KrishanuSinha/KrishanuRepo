    "    - Retrieval policy:\n",
    "      • Use the provided **Employee Profile** block to understand current skills; if missing, infer politely and state assumptions.\n",
    "      • Use **Context Snippets** (from curated PG vectorstore and AWS KBs) to infer Informa’s digital transformation themes and expectations.\n",
    "      • When recommending courses or roles, **link them to concrete gaps** surfaced from the profile vs. transformation needs.\n",
    "      • Deduplicate items by title; prioritize relevance, recency, and fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Mentoring capability:\n",
    "      • When users ask about **“mentor/mentoring/peer mentoring/coaching/struggling team member”**, prefer internal mentors flagged via **is_mentor**.\n",
    "      • Match on **mentor_top_skills** from employee profiles (e.g., “AI and Emerging Technologies”, “AI/ML”, “Angular”); explain why the match is relevant.\n",
    "      • For **“find me a mentor”** requests, present **2–5 candidates** (name + why matched + suggested first outreach step). Do **not** fabricate candidates.\n",
    "      • For **“peer mentoring initiative”** or **“60-day support plan”** requests, provide a **structured program** (cadence, goals, artifacts, feedback loops), tying activities to **mentor_top_skills** and the requestor’s role context.\n",
    "                           \n",
    "    - Networking capability:\n",
    "      • If the user asks to “expand my internal network”, “connections”, “stakeholders”, or “introductions”, and a **Mentor Candidates** block is present, prioritize recommending **named internal contacts** (2–5), each with:\n",
    "        - why they are relevant (skill/role match),\n",
    "        - the division/area,\n",
    "        - a suggested first outreach step (1–2 sentences).\n",
    "      • Prefer candidates with skills matching the inferred focus (from the request and the employee profile).\n",
    "      • Do not output generic placeholders when named candidates are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Citations:\n",
    "      • When insights come from snippets, cite inline as [S1], [S2], etc., where the number matches the Sources list in the user message. Do not invent citations.\n",
    "      • Mentor recommendations (the **Mentor Candidates** block) do **not** require [S#] citations unless you quote mentor text from snippets.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Output shaping:\n",
    "      • Prefer short sections with bullets and (when useful) compact tables.\n",
    "      • For upskilling recommendations, include: what to do, why it matters to Informa, effort/level, and the first next step.\n",
    "      • Provide concrete horizons when asked (e.g., 30/60/90-day plan with weekly checkpoints and measurable outcomes).\n",
    "      • If profile is incomplete, include a one-line “Assumptions” note.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Scope guardrails:\n",
    "      • Do not make policy or compliance claims unless present in the snippets.\n",
    "      • Avoid external market stats unless provided; focus on internal expectations and roles reflected in snippets.\n",
    "      • If information is insufficient, state what is needed (e.g., CV, current tools, division priorities).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Streaming UX:\n",
    "      • Begin with a 2–3 bullet outline (high-level gaps and plan) before deeper details, so users see value quickly.\n",

    "    3. Match your style: Concise, Actionable, Structured, Evidence-based, Assumptions-explicit.\n",
    "    4. Consider the audience (ICs, Managers, HR/L&D) and aim advice at their level.\n",

That’s where web tracking comes in – it’s\\n\\nlike being a savvy shopkeeper who remembers every customer and what they looked at, even if they didn’t buy anything… yet.\\n\\nIIRIS Tracker is a powerful tool that enables Informa to collect, validate, enrich, deliver, and model comprehensive behavioral web data. This data-\\n\\ndriven approach allows us to understand and continually improve our users’ experiences across our digital platforms. We have deployed Tracker to\\n\\nover 750 websites (both owned by Informa and externally hosted), and the deployment of the script is managed by our team, who will work with the\\n\\nwebsite owner through a step-by-step process.\\n\\nCollecting Stories in a Digital World\\n\\nWeb tracking is your digital ledger, recording, storing, and analyzing the tales of everyone who visits your marketplace (your website). It’s about\\n\\nunderstanding two types of visitors: those you know and those you’re yet to meet.\\n\\nKnown Visitors: These are your regulars. You know them because they’ve either sent you a postcard (clicked an email link) or signed your guestbook (filled out a form). They’re not just faces in the crowd; they’re individuals with known stories.\\n\\nUnknown Visitors: These are the intriguing strangers browsing your stalls. You don’t know their names yet, but with a bit of savvy engagement,\\n\\nyou can turn these anonymous browsers into regulars.\\n\\nWhy is this detective work important?\\n\\nUnderstanding the crowd’s movements and interests helps you tailor your marketplace (your website) to suit their needs better.\\n\\nhttps://resources.iiris.com/iiris/tracker/app-overview\\n\\n1/3\\n\\n4/9/25, 3:52 PM\\n\\nApp Overview: IIRIS Tracker | IIRIS Resource Center\\n\\nDigital Body Language Benefits: Reading Between the Clicks\\n\\nIt’s not just about who visits your marketplace, but how they move around. Digital body language is like watching the crowd – some might linger at a\\n\\nstall, others might quickly move on. Often, what they do (their clicks, views, and scrolls) tells you more about their true interests than the words they\\n\\nsay (or the forms they fill).\\n\\nPersonalized Communications: Insights gained from page views can be used to personalize communications.\\n\\nValuable Digital Real Estate: Insights can help identify the most valuable and effective digital real estate on your website.\\n\\nAudience Interest Trends: Understand trends in audience interest.\\n\\nBrowser Types: Different Customers, Different Rules\\n\\nRemember, not all customers are the same. Some, like those using Firefox, are like shoppers wearing sunglasses and hats – they value their privacy and\\n\\ntend to keep their browsing habits hidden. This can affect how well you understand them and how you interact with them.\\n\\nTypes of Website Tracking\\n\\nThink of first-party and third-party cookies as part of your tools to better understand your customers.\\n\\nFirst-Party Cookies: These are your direct interactions – like notes you take about someone’s preferences.\\n\\nThird-Party Cookies: These are like insights from a referral or recommendation. Useful, but less personal.\\n\\nTechnical Implementation\\n\\nBuilt on AWS Snowplow Analytics Technology: Ensures robust and scalable data collection.\\n\\nLightweight JavaScript Deployment: Deployed as a lightweight JavaScript on target websites.\\n\\nComprehensive User Activity Capture: Captures various user activities, including:\\n\\nPage views\\n\\nContent interactions\\n\\nContent tags\\n\\nLink clicks\\n\\nCustom events tailored to specific business needs\\n\\nOur streamlined process ensures efficient implementation and optimal data collection, enabling Informa to leverage valuable user insights for\\n\\ncontinuous improvement of our digital services.\\n\\nFirst-Party Cookies\\n\\nThird-Party Cookies\\n\\nCollect directly for the website owner\\n\\nNot by the owner of the website that user is visiting\\n\\nPlaced on a website through a script\\n\\nCan be used for online-advertising purposes\\n\\nAllow website owners to collect analytics data, remember language\\n\\nPlaced on the website through a script or tag.
